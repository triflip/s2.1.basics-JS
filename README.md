# üß© S2.1 Basic JavaScript Exercises

## üìÑ Description

This repository contains a collection of basic JavaScript exercises designed to practice and understand key programming concepts such as **arrow functions**, **ternary operators**, **callbacks**, **rest and spread operators**, **array transformations and loops**, and **promises / async-await**.

These exercises are structured in levels (Level 1‚Äì3) and progressively increase in difficulty.  
The goal is to strengthen understanding of core JavaScript syntax and programming logic.

## üßæ Exercise Overview

### **1.1 Arrow Functions**
- Convert traditional functions to arrow functions.  
- Create arrow functions with and without parameters.  
- Understand how `this` behaves inside arrow functions.  
- Use arrow functions in loops and asynchronous operations (`setTimeout`).

### **1.2 Ternary Operator**
- Practice conditional logic using the ternary operator.  
- Compare values, chain multiple ternary expressions, and use them inside loops and functions.

### **1.3 Callbacks**
- Pass functions as arguments and execute them later.  
- Perform operations using callbacks.  
- Handle asynchronous actions (e.g., `setTimeout`) and iterate over arrays using callback functions.

### **1.4 Rest & Spread Operators**
- Combine and clone arrays and objects using the spread operator.  
- Handle variable numbers of arguments using the rest operator.  
- Use destructuring with rest parameters and merge objects efficiently.

### **1.5 Array Transformations**
- Use `map`, `filter`, `find`, and `reduce` for array manipulation.  
- Combine multiple array methods in a single line to filter, transform, and sum values.  
- Check conditions in arrays using `every` and `some`.

### **1.6 Array Loops**
- Iterate arrays using `forEach`, `for-of`, and `for-in`.  
- Filter elements, access indexes, and control loop flow with `break`.  
- Explore different looping techniques for objects and arrays.

### **1.7 Promises & Async/Await**
- Create, resolve, and reject promises.  
- Handle asynchronous operations using `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `async/await`.  
- Manage multiple promises with `Promise.all()` and error handling via `try/catch`.

## üíª Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Node.js** (optional, for running scripts)
- **VS Code** or any preferred text editor
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

---

## üìã Requirements
To run the exercises, you need:
- Node.js version **14+**
- A terminal or command-line interface (e.g., Git Bash)
- A web browser (for console testing if desired)
- Git installed for repository management

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/triflip/s2.1.basics-JS.git
   ```

2. **Open the project in your prefered editor**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

3. **(Optional) Initialize Node.js if needed**
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution

Each exercise is written in its own file (e.g., arrow-functions.js, ternary-operator.js, etc.).

To run a specific exercise:
```bash
node arrow-functions.js
node ternary-operator.js
node callbacks.js
```

Or open them in **VS Code** and run directly from the editor‚Äôs console.

## üéØ Learning Goals

- Understand and practice **arrow functions** and `this` context.
- Apply the **ternary operator** for concise conditional logic.
- Learn how **callbacks** manage asynchronous code.
- Use **rest** and **spread** operators effectively in arrays and objects.
- Transform and loop over arrays using different **iteration methods**.
- Work with **Promises** and **async/await** for modern asynchronous programming.
